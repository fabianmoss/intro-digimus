# Goal
Understand what an audio signal is and how it is represented digitally .
:::

Clearly, music is related to sound, and artistic commentaries such as 
John Cage's _4'33_ are exceptions that confirm the rule. 
Thus, in order to understand music and how to encode it, 
we need a basic understanding of how sound works. 

## pure tones 

- amplidute $A$
- frequency $f$ 
- limits of hearing,  Audible range and volume
- intervals: octave and fifth 
- phase $\phi$

$$x(t) = A \sin(2\pi ft + \phi)$$

## Harmonics 

Adding pure tones and decomposition via Fourier (link to 3b1b)

- Timbre 
- Waveform to spectrogram 
- reading melodies from a spectrogram

## Digital audio

- Sampling
