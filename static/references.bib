  abstract = {This textbook provides both profound technological knowledge and a comprehensive treatment of essential topics in music processing and music information retrieval. Including numerous examples, figures, and exercises, this book is suited for students, lecturers, and researchers working in audio engineering, computer science, multimedia, and musicology.The book consists of eight chapters. The first two cover foundations of music representations and the Fourier transform---concepts that are then used throughout the book. In the subsequent chapters, concrete music processing tasks serve as a starting point. Each of these chapters is organized in a similar fashion and starts with a general description of the music processing scenario at hand before integrating it into a wider context. It then discusses---in a mathematically rigorous way---important techniques and algorithms that are generally applicable to a wide range of analysis, classification, and retrieval problems. At the same time, the techniques are directly applied to a specific music processing task. By mixing theory and practice, the book's goal is to offer detailed technological insights as well as a deep understanding of music processing applications. Each chapter ends with a section that includes links to the research literature, suggestions for further reading, a list of references, and exercises. The chapters are organized in a modular fashion, thus offering lecturers and readers many ways to choose, rearrange or supplement the material. Accordingly, selected chapters or individual sections can easily be integrated into courses on general multimedia, information science, signal processing, music informatics, or the digital humanities.},

  abstract = {Music information retrieval (MIR) is ``a multidisciplinary research endeavor that strives to develop innovative content-based searching schemes, novel interfaces, and evolving networked delivery mechanisms in an effort to make the world's vast store of music accessible to all.'' MIR was born from computational musicology in the 1960s and has since grown to have links with music cognition and audio engineering, a dedicated annual conference (ISMIR) and an annual evaluation campaign (MIREX). MIR combines machine learning with expert human knowledge to use digital music data -- images of music scores, ``symbolic'' data such as MIDI files, audio, and metadata about musical items -- for information retrieval, classification and estimation, or sequence labeling. This chapter gives a brief history of MIR, introduces classical MIR tasks from optical music recognition to music recommendation systems, and outlines some of the key questions and directions for future developments in MIR.},

  abstract = {A widely distributed online survey gathered quantitative and qualitative data relating to the use of technology in the research practices of musicologists. This survey builds on existing work in the digital humanities and provides insights into the specific nature of musicology in relation to use and perceptions of technology. Analysis of the data (n=621) notes the preferences in resource format and the digital skills of the survey participants. The themes of comments on rewards, benefits, frustrations, risks, and limitations are explored using an h-point approach derived from applied linguistics. It is suggested that the research practices of musicologists reflect wider existing research into the digital humanities, and that efforts should be made into supporting development of their digital skills and providing usable, useful and reliable software created with a `musicology-centred' design approach. This software should support online access to high quality digital resources (image, text, sound) which are comprehensive and discoverable, and can be shared, reused and manipulated at a micro- and macro level.},
