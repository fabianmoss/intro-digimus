    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nVirtual all aspects of our daily lives are increasingly shaped by data and algorithms. This ‘digital turn’ has also not stopped before academia and science, and most fields are more and more engaging with these new methodologies.\nDigital Musicology (DM) is a term that refers to music research that draws on digital data and digital methods to answer its research questions (Pugin, 2015). Stating a concise definition for the field is difficult, and there is no consensus to date. Moreover, a range of similar terms are frequently being used—for example, Computational Musicology—that have slightly different meanings. Faced with the fact that no common definition of these terms exist, Kris Shaffer attempted to describe some of the main aspects associated with Computational and Digital Musicology (Schaffer, 2016). He names the following subfields, which we will briefly discuss in turn (in an adapted order).",

    "section": "1.2 Overview of the field",
    "text": "1.2 Overview of the field\nShaffer names the following subfields, which we will briefly discuss in turn (in an adapted order).\n\n1.2.1 Music Encoding\nAt the beginning of any digital approach to music stands the question how music is to be represented digitally. Music encoding in the narrower sense asks, how symbolic musical notations such as Common Western Music Notation (CWMN) can be translated into a computer-readable form. During this course, we will get to know a few fundamental symbolic music encoding formats, namely MIDI, ABC, and MEI. Other important formats, e.g. MusicXML or LilyPond, cannot be covered, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI am also teaching a course on music encoding this semester: Digitale Musikkodierung und -edition.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Corpus Studies\nAlthough corpus studies are considered a modern form of music theory, they can look back an an astonishingly long history. Many consider the first corpus study to be Jeppesen’s study The Style of Palestrina and the Dissonance, where he counts and tabulates occurrences of dissonant vertical intervals in the vocal work of the Renaissance composer (Jeppesen, 1927). Further early examples are the dissertations of Budge (1943) and Norman (1945).\nIn a nutshell, corpus attempt to find regularities in large collections of music data (Shanahan et al., 2022) in order to draw conclusions about the style of a particular composer, period, or genre, for instance. Corpus studies thus naturally make use of digital data and statistical or algorithmic methods for their analysis. Corpus studies often try to generalize music theoretical questions from the analysis of individual pieces to entire corpora. They often report their findings in statistical tables or graphical visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the next summer term, I will teach a course on Music Corpus Studies.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Music Information Retrieval\nMusic information retrieval (MIR) is the largest part of DM, and research in this domain is directed both at academic as well as industrial contexts. MIR is closer to computer science, and some of its aspects can be understood as CS applied to music. The primary goal is not always a deeper understanding of music, but for instance improvements of recommendation or classification systems (Burgoyne et al., 2015). Recently, the wave of artificial intelligence (AI) as inspired a renewed interest in music generation, and human-computer co-creativity.\n\n\n1.2.4 Modeling\n(mention here also other forms of computational modeling and computational musicology)\nThe aspects mentioned above are only part of what people nowadays may understand by Computational Musicology. In that sense, Computational Musicology is part of the larger movement of Computational Science, an endeavour that embeds computational methods and thinking into domain-specific areas of research (Wing, 2006). If we have this extended view, we also need to include computational models of music perception and cognition, acoustics, and enthnological and anthropological approaches to music as well. However, this would go beyond the scope of this course.\n\nTo sum up, what we understand by the term “Digital Musicology” depends on who you ask. What is common to the approaches above, however, is the development or use of digital methods as research tools (word processors don’t count, of course). In this course, we focus on the following aspects of Digital Musicology, each of which forms an integral part of its design:\n\nData about music:\nMusic as data: How can music, an ephemeral expression of human culture, be captured or represented as digital data on a computer? What kinds of decisions do we have to make? Which musical aspects are retained and which are lost? Is music as data translatable?\nWorking with music data:\nCritical Digital Musicology: What kinds of ethical and societal issues do we touch upon when doing Digital Musicology? Which important questions do we need to consider before planning or executing a research study?\n\ne.g. digital vs computational; the latter in 2nd semester\ndigital vs empirical vs quantiative\nhow does DM relate to “traditional” subdivisions of musicology?\n\n\nGo to the Exercise for Week 1\n\n\n\n\nBudge, H.

    "text": "Goal\n\n\n\nBe able to name use cases for MIDI. Translate MIDI numbers to pitches.\n\n\nWe have seen last week that the fundamental frequency of complex tones roughly corresponds to what we perceive as pitch. For many musical styles, pitch is one of the most fundamental components, as it is used to construct melodies and harmonies.\nGiven the (fundamental) frequency \\(f\\) of some tone, we can calculate its corresponding MIDI pitch number by making use of a reference note. This is usually A4 in Scientific Pitch Notation, and with a frequency of 440 Hz.\nSo the frequency of that A4 is given by \\[f = 440 \\times 2^{(m-69)/12}\\]\nIn Python, we can write a simple calculation to do this for any given MIDI number:\n\ndef MIDI2frequency(m: int, K: float = 440.0) -&gt; int:\n    f = K * 2 ** ((m - 69) / 12)\n    return f\n\nIf we wanted to know the frequency of the note C5 (MIDI pitch 73), we could simply write:\n\nf_C5 = MIDI2frequency(73)\nprint(f_C5)\n\n554.3652619537442\n\n\nWith the invention of electronic instruments in the 20th century, and the possibility of representing continuous sounds as digital signals, it became important for those instruments to interact and communicate. This led to the development of the Musical Instruments Digital Interface (MIDI) format that is still a cornerstone for music information exchange.\nMIDI is relatively simple: it consists of so-called messages that have five components:\n\nTime (in ticks)\nMessage (either NOTE ON or NOTE OFF)\nChannel (up to 16 for classical MIDI)\nNote number (integers between 0 and 127)\nVelocity (simulating the speed of pressing down a key, proxy for volume)\n\nIn that way, MIDI resembles the much older ‘piano roll’ representation for musical notes.\nADD PIANO ROLL IMAGE HERE\nExercise:\n\nTranscribe simple melody to MIDI and plot using pypianoroll.\nDownload multitrack MIDI from the internet and visualize.\nDescribe what can be read from a pianoroll visualization, and what is missing.",

    "text": "11.1 XML\nFor a computer, text is merely a string of characters, including ‘invisible’ characters such as spaces between words and line breaks. But texts are usually more structured than that. For instance, they can contain headings, sections, subsections or paragraphs; they can be printed onto different pages, and they can change their appearance by including boldfaced or italicized text, for example. If we want to encode these structural aspects of texts in machine-readable formats, they need to be explicitly marked up.\nThe most popular mark-up language for all sorts of texts is the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML documents consist of a so-called XML declaration that tells the computer which structuring elements are available and how to interpret them, as well as several tags and their attributes. This is easily explained with an example:\nThis example contains two types of elements: message and greeting. Elements work a little bit like parentheses ((, )) or brackets ([, ]) because there is (almost) always an opening tag and a closing tag. Closing tags contain a slash (/).\nThe example also shows that tags can be hierarchically nested. If the message consisted of several parts, it could be encoded as follows:\nWe say that greeting and politeness are children of message (they are siblings), and greeting is the parent element.\nElements can contain so-called attributes that modify the element. Attributes are listed only in the opening tag of the element. In the example above, the greeting element contained the attribute @emotion with the value \"joyful\". It is customary to add an @ when talking about an attribute. Attribute values need to be enclosed in quotation marks (\"), see also attributes @version and @encoding of the XML declaration in the first code line.",

Apart from merely representing what is written or printed in a musical score, musicologists understand that musical texts always stand in certain contexts, and that musical sources need commentaries, corrections, and critical treatment more generally. In short, while CWMN is easily represented by other encoding formats such as MusicXML and LilyPond, MEI is the prime candidate for musicological applications due to this critical layer.",

Now, we ask whether the pitch of the notes in the solos are related to another important feature of performance: loudness. The WJazzD contains several measures for loudness (compare the columns in the solos DataFrame). Here, we focus on the “Median loudness” which is stored in the loud_med column.\nLet us look at an example.\n\nexample_solo = solos[ solos[\"melid\"] == 233 ][[\"pitch\", \"loud_med\"]]\n\n\nexample_solo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npitch\nloud_med\n\n\n\n\n115075\n62.0\n67.082700\n\n\n115076\n65.0\n65.345677\n\n\n115077\n67.0\n66.323539\n\n\n115078\n69.0\n69.204257\n\n\n115079\n62.0\n69.059581\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n115549\n59.0\n61.083907\n\n\n115550\n57.0\n58.345887\n\n\n115551\n55.0\n65.132786\n\n\n115552\n54.0\n59.595735\n\n\n115553\n53.0\n58.390132\n\n\n\n\n479 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\n\nWe can get a visual impression of whether there might be a direct relation between the two features by plotting it and drawing a regression line. For this, the regplot() function of the seaborn library is well-suited.\n\nsns.regplot(data=example_solo, x=\"pitch\", y=\"loud_med\", line_kws={\"color\":\"black\"});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be no clear relation; no matter how high the pitch, the loudness stays more or less the same. Let’s look at another example!\n\nexample_solo2 = solos[ solos[\"melid\"] == 333 ][[\"pitch\", \"loud_med\"]]\n\nsns.regplot(data=example_solo2, x=\"pitch\", y=\"loud_med\", line_kws={\"color\":\"black\"});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, there is a positive trend. The higher the pitch, the louder the performer plays. Since we have now two different examples - in one case no relation, in the other case a positive correlation - we should now look at whether there is a trend emerging from all solos taken together.",

Since we don’t want length (or the absolute number of notes in a piece) to have an effect, we rather consider tonal pitch-class distributions instead counts, by normalizing all pieces to sum to one.\n\ntpc_dists = tpc_counts.div(tpc_counts.sum(axis=1),

further numerical analysis, we extract the data from this table and assign it to a variable X.\n\n# extract values of table to matrix\nX = tpc_dists.values\n\nX.shape # shows (#rows, #columns) of X\n\n(2012, 35)\n\n\nNow, X is a 2012 \\(\\times\\) 35 matrix where the rows represent the pieces and the columns (also called “features” or “dimensions”) represent the relative frequency of tonal pitch-classes.\nThinking in 35 dimensions is quite difficult for most people. Without trying to imagine what this would look like, what can we already say about this data?\nSince each piece is a point in this 35-D space and pieces are represented as vectors, pieces that have similar tonal pitch-class distributions must be close in this space (whatever this looks like).\nWhat groups of pieces that cluster together? Maybe pieces of the same composer are similar to each other? Maybe pieces from a similar time? Maybe pieces for the same instruments?\nIf we find clusters, these would still be in 35-D and thus difficult to interpret. Luckily, there are a range of so-called dimensionality reduction methods that transform the data into lower-dimensional spaces so that we actually can look at them.\nA very common dimensionality reduction method is Principal Components Analysis (PCA).\nThe basic idea of PCA is:\n\nfind dimensions in the data that maximize the variance in this direction\nthese dimensions have to be orthogonal to each other (mutually independent)\nthese dimensions are called the principal components\neach principal component is associated with how much of the data variance it explains\n\n\nimport numpy as np # for numerical computations\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA # for dimensionality reduction\n\npca = sklearn.decomposition.PCA(n_components=35) # initialize PCA with 35 dimensions\npca.fit(X) # apply it to the data\nvariance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_ # assign explained variance to variable\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14,5))\nx = np.arange(35)\nax.plot(x, variance, label=\"relative\", marker=\"o\")\nax.plot(x, variance.cumsum(), label=\"cumulative\", marker=\"o\")\nax.set_xlim(-0.5, 35)\nax.set_ylim(-0.1, 1.1)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Principal Components\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Explained variance\")\nplt.xticks(np.arange(len(lof)), np.arange(len(lof)) + 1) # because Pyhon starts counting at 0\n\nplt.legend(loc=\"center right\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n# plt.savefig(\"img/explained_variance.png\")\n# plt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariance[:5]\n\narray([0.41144591, 0.23410347, 0.09063507, 0.07574242, 0.04436989])\n\n\nThe first principal component explains 41.1% of the variance of the data, the second explains 23.4% and the third 9%. Together, this amounts to 73.6%.\nAlmost three quarters of the variance in the dataset is retained by reducing the dimensionality from 35 to 3 dimensions (8.6%)! If we reduce the data to two dimensions, we still can explain \\(\\approx\\) 65% of the variance.\nThis is great because it means that we can look at the data in 2 or 3 dimensions without loosing too much information.",

This means, its range on the line of fifths is \\(10 - (-1) = 11\\). The piece covers eleven consecutive fifths on the lof.\nWe can generalize this calculation and write a function that calculates the range for each piece in the dataset.\n\ndef lof_range(piece):\n    l

You choose a name for the variable, and assign a value to it using the = operator, for example:\nx = 100\nassigns the value 100 to the variable x. If we call the variable now, we can see that it has the value we assigned to it:\nx\n\n100\nOf course, we can also assign things other than numbers, for example:\nname = \"Fabian\"\nWhat we assigned to the variable name is called a string, it has the value \"Fabian\". Strings are sequences of characters.\nWe can also assign a list of things to a variable:\nmylist = [1, 2, 3, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\nLists are enclosed by square brackets. As you can see, Python allows you to store any kind of data in lists (here: integer numbers and character strings). However, it is good practice to include only items of the same type in lists—you’ll understand later why.\nAnother structured data type in python are dictionaries. Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. For example, a dictionary addresses could store the email addresses of certain people:\naddresses = {\n    \"Andrew\" : \"andrew@example.com\",\n    \"Zoe\" : \"zoe@example.com\"\n}\nNow, if we wanted to look up Zoe’s email address, we could to so with:\naddresses[\"Zoe\"]\n\n'zoe@example.com'",

    "text": "On repeat\nCoding something is only useful if you can’t do the job as fast or as efficient by yourself. Especially when it comes to repeating the same little thing many, many times, knowing how to code comes in handy.\nAs a simple example, imagine you want to write down all numbers from 1 to 10, or from 1 to 100, or… you get the idea. In Python, you would do it as follows:\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\nYou see that this is not exactly what we wanted. We’re seeing numbers from 0 to 9, each one being printed on a new line. But what we wanted was all numbers from 1 to 10. Before we fix the code to produce the desired result, let’s explain the bits and pieces of the code above.\nWhat we just did was to use a so-called for-loop, probably the most common way to repeat things in Python. First we create an iterator variable i (we could have named any other variable name as well), which takes its value from the list of numbers specified by range(10). If only one number n is provided to range(n), it will enumerate all numbers from 0 to n-1. If instead two arguments are provided, the first one determines the starting number, and the second one stands for the terminating number minus one—confusing, right?\nSo, in order to enumerate all numbers from 1 to 10, we have to write range(1,11). Additionally, we can use the end keyword of the print function that allows us to print all numbers in one line, separated only by a single white space instead of each one on a new line.\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    print(i, end=\" \")\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \n\n\nVoilà!",

    "section": "Just in case",
    "text": "Just in case\nOften we encounter a situation where we would execute some code only if certain conditions are met. In python, this is done with the if statement. For example, if we want to only print the even numbers in the range from 1 to 10, we could adapt the code from above as follows:\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i, \"is even\")\n\n2 is even\n4 is even\n6 is even\n8 is even\n10 is even\n\n\nYou can read this as “if the remainder of dividing i by 2 is zero, then print ‘i is even’”.\nNow, we could also want to print a similar statement in the case that i is odd:\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i, \"is even\")\n    else:\n        print(i, \"is odd\")\n\n1 is odd\n2 is even\n3 is odd\n4 is even\n5 is odd\n6 is even\n7 is odd\n8 is even\n9 is odd\n10 is even\n\n\nAnd, finally, we could also have more than just one condition. An if-statement allows for arbitrary many if-else clauses, with which we can formulate several different conditions by writing elif (shorthand for ‘or else if’):\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i, \"is even\")\n    elif i % 3 == 0:\n        print(i, \"is divisible by 3\")\n    else:\n        print(i, \"is odd\")\n\n1 is odd\n2 is even\n3 is divisible by 3\n4 is even\n5 is odd\n6 is even\n7 is odd\n8 is even\n9 is divisible by 3\n10 is even\n\n\nWe now know when a number is even and when it is divisible by 3. But what about numbers that are both even and divisible by 3? We just add another condition to the elif statement and enclose each condition in parentheses, so that Python knows how things group together:\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i, \"is even\")\n    elif (i % 2 == 0) and (i % 3 == 0):\n        print(i, \"is even and divisible by 3\")\n    else:\n        print(i, \"is odd\")\n\n1 is odd\n2 is even\n3 is odd\n4 is even\n5 is odd\n6 is even\n7 is odd\n8 is even\n9 is odd\n10 is even\n\n\nWhy did this not work? The number 6 is even and divisible by 3! The reason is that the three statements (if, elif, and else) are being executed in the order that we wrote them down. That means, that Python will first check for each number whether it is even (and nothing more), and if it is, it will follow the instruction to print it and go on to the next number. So, once we arrived at 6, the programm will only check if the number is even. That is not the desired result and we have to make a little change to it. We will switch the conditions in the if and elif statements:\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    if (i % 2 == 0) and (i % 3 == 0):\n        print(i, \"is even and divisible by 3\")\n    elif i % 2 == 0:\n        print(i, \"is even\")\n    else:\n        print(i, \"is odd\")\n\n1 is odd\n2 is even\n3 is odd\n4 is even\n5 is odd\n6 is even and divisible by 3\n7 is odd\n8 is even\n9 is odd\n10 is even\n\n\nNow it works! Note that new never specified any conditions for the else statement. This is because whatever follows it will be executed in case none of the conditions in if or elif are met.",

    "text": "Functions\nWith more and more experience in programming, it is likely that your code will become more and more complex. That means that it will become harder to keep track of what every piece of it is supposed to do. A good strategy to deal with this is to aim for writing code that is modular: it can be broken down into smaller units (modules) that are easier to understand. Moreover, it is sometimes necessary to reuse the same code several times. It would, however, be inefficient to write the same lines over and over again. With your code being modular you can wrap the pieces that you need in several places into a function.\nLet’s look at an example! Assume, your (fairly) complex code involves calculating the sum of the squares of two numbers. In Python, we use the + operator to calculate sums and the ** operator to raise a number to a certain power (**2 for the square of a number).\n\nx = 3\ny = 5\n\nsum_of_squares = x**2 + y**2\n\nThe variable sum_of_squares now contains the sum of squares of x=3 and y=5. We can inspect the result by calling the variable:\n\nsum_of_squares \n\n34\n\n\nNow, imagine that you would have to do the same calculation several times for different combinations of values for x and y (and always keeping in mind that this stands in for much more complex examples with several lines of code). We can code this in a function:\n\ndef func_sum_of_squares(x, y):\n    return x**2 + y**2\n\nNow, each time we want to calculate a sum of squares, we can do so by simply invoking\n\nfunc_sum_of_squares(5,4)\n\n41\n\n\nAnd, of course, we could chose a shorter name for the function as well, although I would recommend to always use function names that make clear what the function does:\n\nf = func_sum_of_squares\n\nf(5,4)\n\n41",

There is a huge community of Python programmers out there that works and collaborates on several libraries. A library is (more or less) simply a collection of certain functions (and some more, but we don’t get into this here). This means, instead of writing a function yourself, you can rely on functions that someone else has programmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhether a Python library or function does actually do what it promises is another story. Popular libraries with tens of thousands of users are very trust-worthy because you can be almost sure that someone would have noticed erroneous behavior. But it is certainly possible that badly-maintained libraries contain errors. So be prudent when using the code of others.\n\n\n\nNumPy\nOne of the most popular Python libaries is NumPy for numerical computations. We will rely a lot on the functions in this library, especially in order to draw random samples—more on this later! To use the functions or variables from this library, they have to be imported so that you can use them. There are several ways to do this. For example, you can import the libary entirely:\n\nimport numpy\n\nNow, you can use the (approximated) value of \\(\\pi\\) stored in this library by typing\n\nnumpy.pi\n\n3.141592653589793\n\n\nA different way is to just import everything from the library by writing\n\nfrom numpy import * \n\nHere, the * stands for ‘everything’. Now, to use the value of \\(\\pi\\) we could simply type\n\npi\n\n3.141592653589793\n\n\nThis is, however discouraged for the following reason: imagine we had another library, numpy2 that also stores the value of \\(\\pi\\), but less precisely (e.g. only as 3.14). If we write\n\nfrom numpy import * \nfrom numpy2 import * \n\nWe would have imported the variables holding the value of \\(\\pi\\) from both libraries. But, because they have the same name pi. In this case, pi would equal 3.14 because we imported numpy2 last. This is confusing and shouldn’t be so! To avoid this, it is better to keep references to imported libraries explicit. In order not to have to type too much (we’re all lazy, after all), we can define an alias for the library.\n\nimport numpy as np\nnp.pi\n\n3.141592653589793\n\n\nAll functions of NumPy are now accessible with the prefix np..\n\n\nPandas\n[TODO]\n\n\nMatplotlib\n[TODO]\n\n\nSummary\nYou can choose any alias when importing a library (it can even by longer than the library name) but certain conventions have emerged that you’re encouraged to follow. Importing the most commonly used Python libraries for data-science tasks (“The data science triad”), use the following:\n\nimport numpy as np # for numerical computations\nimport pandas as pd # for tabular data \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for data visualization\n\nWe will use all three of them in the following chapters and you’ll learn to love them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcepts covered\n\n\n\n\nvariables\ntypes (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries)\nfunctions\nlibraries, importing and aliases",

    "text": "Finding Similarities and Differences in Folk Melodies with Python and Pandas\nIn this exercise we will have a look at the Essen Folksong Collection (EFD). It is a database of Folksongs from all around the world gathered by the ethnomusicologist Helmut Schaffrath (1995). The collection can be downloaded from this website. It comes in the **kern format that is a table of note events where the rows correspond to event time.\nWe will answer a very specific question:\nWhat can we learn about musical scales when we look at the notes in a musical piece?\nFor this purpose and also due to limited time, we need to make some simplifications. We will only consider note counts. That means, for this excercise we just count all the notes in a piece but do not care how long the notes are. Another way to say it is that we are just interested in the pitch dimension.\nNotes in the EFD come as spelled pitches. Spelled pitches have three parts: 1. the diatonic step (C, D, E, F, G, A, or B) 2. possibly one or two accidentals (# or b) 3. the octave in which the note sounds\nMoreover, we will reduce the pitches in a melody to pitch classe. This means we do not differentiate between the same pitches in different octaves, e.g. C4 and C5, nor will we distinguish between enharmonically equivalent pitches, such as F#3 and Gb3.\nThis way, each piece can be represented as a list of pitch classes that can then be counted.\nBecause it is not straight-forward to work with **kern scores in Python, the data was already transformed into DataFrame format and exported to data.csv.\nFirst, we need to import sum libraries that contain the functions that we will use for the data analysis. If you do not have one or more of the packages installed, run conda install packages-names in a command-line tool (as adminstrator).\nimport numpy as np # for numerical computation (we need it to transpose melodies)\nimport pandas as pd # to organize our data in tabular format\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # to visualize results \nimport seaborn as sns # more advanced visualization tools\n# directly show the plots in the notebook\n%matplotlib inline \n\nimport re # regular expressions: for pattern finding in strings",

We still need to transpose all songs into the same key so that we can compare their pitch-class distributions. Let’s think a moment about how this can be done. We have the pitch-class distribution of each song in counts, and we have key, root, and mode in data.\nLet’s say that we want to transpose all songs to the root C. C major and C minor pieces do not have to change. A piece in G major, for instance, has the root 7 and needs to be transposed to the root 0. A piece in Bb minor has the root 10 and needs do be transposed to the root 0. The easiest way to do this is to ‘rotate’ the pitch-class distributions by the negative amount of the root. Luckily, numpy provides the roll function to do exactly that. It takes an array (a vector) and rolls it by the specified amount. We do this for all songs in data and save the result in a new DataFrame transposed.\n\ntransposed = pd.DataFrame(\n    [ np.roll( normalized.iloc[i,:], -data['root'][i] ) for i in range(len(data)) ]\n    )\n\ntransposed.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.014815\n0.007407\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.0\n0.125926\n0.237037\n0.214815\n0.170370\n0.081481\n0.088889\n0.059259\n\n\n1\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.107692\n0.092308\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.076923\n0.123077\n0.138462\n0.076923\n0.384615\n\n\n2\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.114286\n0.085714\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.071429\n0.142857\n0.157143\n0.071429\n0.357143\n\n\n3\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.107692\n0.092308\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.076923\n0.123077\n0.138462\n0.076923\n0.384615\n\n\n4\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.114286\n0.085714\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.071429\n0.142857\n0.157143\n0.071429\n0.357143\n\n\n5\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.187500\n0.062500\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.250000\n0.187500\n0.062500\n0.000000\n0.250000\n\n\n6\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.333333\n0.000000\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.181818\n0.303030\n0.030303\n0.151515\n\n\n7\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.312500\n0.000000\n0.0\n0.208333\n0.145833\n0.250000\n0.000000\n0.041667\n0.041667\n0.000000\n\n\n8\n0.000000\n0.045455\n0.181818\n0.000000\n0.0\n0.181818\n0.204545\n0.250000\n0.000000\n0.090909\n0.045455\n0.000000\n\n\n9\n0.000000\n0.039216\n0.333333\n0.000000\n0.0\n0.117647\n0.156863\n0.196078\n0.000000\n0.156863\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can already observe that none of the first 10 songs in the dataset has the tritone (pitch class 6), and only one has a minor third (pitch class 3) or a minor seventh (pitch class 10).\nIt would be nice not having to work with to DataFrames, data and transposed, so we combine (concatenate) them in a new one, just called df.\n\ndf = pd.concat([data, transposed], axis=1)\n\n\ndf.shape\n\n(9372, 17)\n\n\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nkey\nspelled_pitches\nroot\nmode\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n\n\n0\nMuwaschah Lamma Bada\ng minor\n[D5, G5, A5, B-5, C6, B-5, B-5, A5, A5, G5, G5...\n7\nminor\n0.014815\n0.007407\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.0\n0.125926\n0.237037\n0.214815\n0.170370\n0.081481\n0.088889\n0.059259\n\n\n1\nCUCA 1\nF major\n[C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, F4, F...\n5\nmajor\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.107692\n0.092308\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.076923\n0.123077\n0.138462\n0.076923\n0.384615\n\n\n2\nCUCA 2\nF major\n[C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, F4, F...\n5\nmajor\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.114286\n0.085714\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.071429\n0.142857\n0.157143\n0.071429\n0.357143\n\n\n3\nCUCA 1\nF major\n[C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, F4, F...\n5\nmajor\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.107692\n0.092308\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.076923\n0.123077\n0.138462\n0.076923\n0.384615\n\n\n4\nCUCA 2\nF major\n[C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, C4, C4, C4, F4, A4, F4, F...\n5\nmajor\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.114286\n0.085714\n0.0\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.071429\n0.142857\n0.157143\n0.071429\n0.357143",

    "text": "1.2 Music Encoding\nAt the beginning of any digital approach to music stands the question how music is to be represented digitally. Music encoding in the narrower sense asks, how symbolic musical notations such as Common Western Music Notation (CWMN) can be translated into a computer-readable form. During this course, we will get to know a few fundamental symbolic music encoding formats, namely MIDI, ABC, and MEI. Other important formats, e.g. MusicXML or LilyPond, cannot be covered, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI am also teaching a course on music encoding this semester: Digitale Musikkodierung und -edition.\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Corpus Studies\nAlthough corpus studies are considered a modern form of music theory, they can look back an an astonishingly long history. Many consider the first corpus study to be Jeppesen’s study The Style of Palestrina and the Dissonance, where he counts and tabulates occurrences of dissonant vertical intervals in the vocal work of the Renaissance composer (Jeppesen, 1927). Further early examples are the dissertations of Budge (1943) and Norman (1945).\nIn a nutshell, corpus attempt to find regularities in large collections of music data (Shanahan et al., 2022) in order to draw conclusions about the style of a particular composer, period, or genre, for instance. Corpus studies thus naturally make use of digital data and statistical or algorithmic methods for their analysis. Corpus studies often try to generalize music theoretical questions from the analysis of individual pieces to entire corpora. They often report their findings in statistical tables or graphical visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the next summer term, I will teach a course on Music Corpus Studies.",

    "text": "1.3 Music Information Retrieval\nMusic information retrieval (MIR) is the largest part of DM, and research in this domain is directed both at academic as well as industrial contexts. MIR is closer to computer science, and some of its aspects can be understood as CS applied to music. The primary goal is not always a deeper understanding of music, but for instance improvements of recommendation or classification systems (Burgoyne et al., 2015). Recently, the wave of artificial intelligence (AI) as inspired a renewed interest in music generation, and human-computer co-creativity.",

    "section": "1.4 Modeling",
    "text": "1.4 Modeling\n“Modeling” in the scientific sense means to represent some aspect of reality in a simplified manner so that it can be easier studied and understood. If models are specified in such a way that machines can understand them, we speak of formal or computational models. Computational models can be used to perform tasks that are usually done by humans. For example, streaming services such as Spotify use computational models to categorize the songs on their platforms or to automatically create playlists. While models can achieve and even surpass human capabilities in some cases, this does not mean that computational models and humans use the same strategies or mechanisms to achieve certain goals.\nTherefore, computational modeling is also employed in fields such as music perception and cognition, where the focus does not lie on the optimal performance regarding some task, but in the understanding of how human cognition works. Often, however, computational modeling and music cognition go hand in hand because formal models are very convenient to express complex representations or behaviors.\nIn this sense, Computational Musicology is part of the larger movement of Computational Science, an endeavour that embeds computational methods and thinking into domain-specific areas of research (Wing, 2006). If we have this extended view, we also need to include computational models of music perception and cognition, acoustics, and enthnological and anthropological approaches to music as well. However, this would go beyond the scope of this course.\n\nTo sum up, what we understand by the term “Digital Musicology” depends on who you ask. What is common to the approaches above, however, is the development or use of digital methods as research tools.1 The more computational and modeling aspects of digital music research will be covered in other courses. In this course, we focus on the following aspects of Digital Musicology, each of which forms an integral part of its design:\n\nData about music: What is music metadata? How is music organized in different databases? Where is the boundary between music and data?\nMusic as data: How can music, an ephemeral expression of human culture, be captured or represented as digital data on a computer? What kinds of decisions do we have to make? Which musical aspects are retained and which are lost? Is music as data translatable?\nWorking with music data: What kinds of questions can we ask and attempt to answer when we have music data at hand? Which challenges to arise if we read instead of listening to music?\nCritical Digital Musicology: What kinds of ethical and societal issues do we touch upon when doing Digital Musicology? Which important questions do we need to consider before planning or executing a research study? How does Digital Musicology relate\nto other musicological sub-areas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization notes\n\n\n\nExercises\nEach week concludes with a number of exercises that deepen or expand upon the topics discussed in the seminar. Doing the exercises is essential for a successful completion of the course.\nCredit\n\n50% Final exam\n30% Exercises\n20% Homework\n\n\n\nGo to the Exercise for Week 1\n\n\n\n\nBudge, H. (1943).
