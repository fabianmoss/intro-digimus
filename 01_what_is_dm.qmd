## Introduction

Virtual all aspects of our daily lives are increasingly shaped by data and algorithms. 
The 'digital turn' has also not stopped before academia and science, and most fields are more and more engaging with these new methodologies.

**Digital Musicology** (DM) is a term that refers to music research that draws on digital data 
and digital methods to answer its research questions. Stating a concise definition for the field 
is difficult, and there is no consensus to date. Moreover, a range of similar terms are 
frequently being used, for example, Computational Musicology. 

## Overview of the field 

Faced with the fact that 
no common definition of these terms exist, Kris Shaffer attempted to describe some of 
the main aspects associated with Computational Musicology [@Schaffer2016]. 
He names the following subfields, which we will briefly discuss in turn (in an adapted order). 

### Music Encoding 

At the beginning of any digital approach to music stands the question how music 
is to be represented digitally. Music encoding in the narrower sense asks, 
how _symbolic_ musical notations such as Common Western Music Notation (CWMN) 
can be translated into a computer-readable form. 
During this course, we will get to know a few fundamental symbolic music encoding formats,
namely MIDI, ABC, and MEI. Other important formats, e.g. MusicXML or LilyPond, 
cannot be covered, unfortunately.

### Corpus Studies 

Although corpus studies are considered a modern form of music theory, 
they can look back an an astonishingly long history. Many consider the first 
corpus study to be Jeppesen's study _The Style of Palestrina and the Dissonance_,
where he counts and tabulates occurrences of dissonant vertical intervals in the 
vocal work of the Renaissance composer [@Jeppesen1927]. Further early examples 
are the dissertations of @Budge1943 and @Norman1945.

In a nutshell, corpus attempt to find regularities in large collections of 
music data [@Shanahan2022] in order to draw conclusions about the style of a particular 
composer, period, or genre, for instance. Corpus studies thus naturally make use 
of digital data and statistical or algorithmic methods for their analysis. 
Corpus studies often try to generalize music theoretical questions from the 
analysis of individual pieces to entire corpora. They often report their findings 
in statistical tables or graphical visualizations.

### Music Information Retrieval

Music information retrieval (MIR) is the largest part of DM, and research in this domain 
is directed both at academic as well as industrial contexts. MIR is closer to computer science, 
and some of its aspects can be understood as CS applied to music. The primary goal is 
not always a deeper understanding of music, but for instance improvements of recommendation 
or classification systems [@BurgoyneMIR2015]. Recently, the wave of artificial intelligence (AI) as 
inspired a renewed interest in music generation, and human-computer co-creativity. 

### Modeling 

(mention here also other forms of computational modeling and computational musicology)

The aspects mentioned above are only part of what people nowadays may understand 
by Computational Musicology. In that sense, Computational Musicology is part of the larger 
movement of Computational Science, an endeavour that embeds computational methods and thinking 
into domain-specific areas of research [@Wing2006]. If we have this extended view, 
we also need to include computational models of music perception and cognition, acoustics, 
and enthnological and anthropological approaches to music as well. However, this would go 
beyond the scope of this course. 

---

To sum up, what we understand by the term "Digital Musicology" depends on who you ask. 
What is common to the approaches above, however, is the development or use of digital 
methods as research tools (word processors don't count, of course).
In this course, we focus on the following aspects of Digital Musicology, each of which 
forms an integral part of its design:

- **Data about music:**
- **Music as data:** How can music, an ephemeral expression of human culture, be captured
  or represented as digital data on a computer? What kinds of decisions do we have to make?
  Which musical aspects are retained and which are lost? Is music as data translatable?
- **Working with music data:** 
- **Critical Digital Musicology**: What kinds of ethical and societal issues do we 
  touch upon when doing Digital Musicology? Which important questions do we need to consider 
  before planning or executing a research study? 

  - e.g. digital vs computational; the latter in 2nd semester
  - digital vs empirical vs quantiative
  - how does DM relate to "traditional" subdivisions of musicology?
