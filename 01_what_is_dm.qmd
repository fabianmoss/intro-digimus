## Introduction

Virtual all aspects of our daily lives are increasingly shaped by data and algorithms. 
The 'digital turn' has also not stopped before academia and science, and most fields 
are more and more engaging with these new methodologies.

**Digital Musicology** (DM) is a term that refers to music research that draws on digital data 
or uses digital methods to answer its research questions. But defining what DM exactly is
is difficult, and there is no consensus to date. Moreover, a range of similar terms are 
frequently being used, for example, Computational Musicology. 

## Overview of the field 

Faced with the fact that 
no common definition of these terms exist, Kris Shaffer attempted to describe some of 
the main aspects associated with Computational Musicology [@Schaffer2016]. 
He names the following subfields, which we will briefly discuss in turn. 

### Corpus Studies 

### Modeling 

### Music Encoding 

### Music Information Retrieval

The aspects mentioned above are only part of what people nowadays may understand 
by Computational Musicology. In that sense, Computational Musicology is part of the larger 
movement of Computational Science, an endeavour that embeds computational methods and thinking 
into domain-specific areas of research [@Wing2006]. If we have this extended view, 
we also need to include computational models of music perception and cognition, acoustics, 
and enthnological and anthropological approaches to music as well. However, this would go 
beyond the scope of this course.

In this course, we focus on the following aspects of Digital Musicology, each of which 
forms an integral part of its design:

- **Data about music:**
- **Music as data:** How can music, an ephemeral expression of human culture, be captured
  or represented as digital data on a computer? What kinds of decisions do we have to make?
  Which musical aspects are retained and which are lost? Is music as data translatable?
- **Working with music data:** 
- **Critical Digital Musicology**: What kinds of ethical and societal issues do we 
  touch upon when doing Digital Musicology? Which important questions do we need to consider 
  before planning or executing a research study? 

  - e.g. digital vs computational; the latter in 2nd semester
  - digital vs empirical vs quantiative
  - how does DM relate to "traditional" subdivisions of musicology?

# Homework
1. Read @Schaffer2016. 
2. Discuss with your peers unclear terms and find answers.
3. Find aspects of Computational Musicology that you think are 
   underrepresented in Schaffer's list.
