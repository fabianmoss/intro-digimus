## Exercise for Week 1 {.unnumbered}

In the remainder of the course, we will engage with data and computer code.
While this is probably new for most of you, there are luckily many tools 
that can help us to do so more easily. 

1. Create a directory/folder named `intro-digimus` for this course (**note:** no spaces!). 
   You can use any location on your personal computer 
   or on your J:\ drive provided by the university.
1. As code editor we will use [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   Install the program on your machine. 
1. Open the directory you just created and install the Jupyter Extension.
1. Create a new Jupyter notebook named `test.ipynb` and write the following in the first cell:
   `print("Hello world!")`. Congratulations, you wrote your first computer program!
