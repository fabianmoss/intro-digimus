Renaissance Cadences
====================

This part of the course was taught by `Prof. Richard Freedman, Haverford College <https://www.haverford.edu/users/rfreedma>`_
who introduced the `Lost Voices project <http://digitalduchemin.org/>`_ and in particular how one can use this corpus for both close and distant reading analyses.
