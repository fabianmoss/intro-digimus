::: {.callout-note}
# Goal
Understand the difference between representativeness and representation.
Obtain a critical understanding of biases relevant for data selection.

- Representation and the canon
- Representing means modeling means abstraction (what is "music" in "music encoding"?)
- biases: how to recognize them, how to deal with them, and when biases are a good thing.
- FAIR and CARE
